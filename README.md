# Fitness Tracker
Android application that will interface with a project my friend Kyle Rosales
(https://github.com/kjrosales) is working on. He is handling the server-side
and working on APIs to authenticate users and store/retrieve data.

### Features
- Cardio: log time/distance
- Wights: log weight used/repetitions
- "Off the grid mode" to store all data locally on the device (warning: wiping
data for the application will delete your account and you will have to create
a new one. Exercise data will not be backed up to the server and everything will be lost)
- BMI calculator
- Calorie calculator
- Rest timer
- View graphs of progress over time
- Option to require pin/pattern/password/fingerprint to access the app
